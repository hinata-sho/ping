## Ping-Pong Game


Description:

Ping-Pong Game is an interactive user-versus-AI game that brings the classic ping-pong arcade experience to your browser. This one-of-a-kind game pits you against an AI opponent with a unique twistâ€”the AI-controlled paddle mimics your mouse movements but at a slightly slower pace.


How to Play:

Objective: The goal of the game is to score points by bouncing the ball past the AI-controlled paddle and into the opponent's goal.

User Paddle: You control your paddle with your mouse movements. Move your mouse left or right to position the paddle accordingly.

AI Paddle: The AI-controlled paddle moves in sync with your mouse but at a reduced speed. This adds a challenging dynamic to the game.

Scoring: Each time the ball passes the AI paddle and enters the opponent's goal, you score a point.

Winning: The game continues until a player reaches a predefined score, and the player with the highest score wins.
